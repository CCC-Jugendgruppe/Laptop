# Custom ISO

## Note for VMs

The preseed assumes the drive to install grub to is `/dev/sda`. Some VM Managers
like virt-manager use /dev/vda by default. For virt-manager you need to set the
disks `Bus Type`to SATA

The iso currently does not work with UEFI VMs. Use BIOS instead. It works on
hardware with UEFI.

## Hostname

The Hostname promt doesnt work with BIOS on both Hardware and VMs. Use UEFI if
Possible or configure it manually after installing.

2. Move it here and rename it to debian12.iso
3. run `make setup`

## Compiling

1. Run `make build`

# Todo

- [x] Setup SSH Key
- [x] Hostname question not shown when using BIOS
- [x] ISO not booting on UEFI VMs
- [x] switch to KDE
